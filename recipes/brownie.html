        <p>You’ll find a full, step-by-step recipe below — but here’s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade brookies: </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Make the cookie dough and press it into a greased baking dish. </li>
            <li>Make the brownie batter and spread it over the cookie layer. </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick comes out clean. </li>
            <li>Cut the brookies into bars.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <strong>Tip:</strong> If you’re short on time, you can use store-bought chocolate chip cookie dough instead of making the cookies.

    </h2><strong>How to Make Brookies Step-By-Step</strong></h2>
        
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</p>

        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>
            Prepare cookie layer: Beat 1/2 cup butter, 
            1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla in a large bowl until creamy. 
            Add one egg; beat until light and creamy, about 2 minutes.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>
            Whisk 1 1/4 cups flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and baking soda in a bowl. 
            Gradually stir flour mixture into butter mixture until dough is combined. 
            Stir chocolate chips into dough. 
            Spread dough evenly into the prepared baking dish; set aside.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>
            Prepare brownie layer: Stir 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup melted butter, and 1 teaspoon vanilla in a bowl; add two eggs and beat well.
            Mix in cocoa powder until well-combined. Stir in 1/2 cup flour, baking powder, and 1/8 teaspoon salt until batter is combined. 
            Pour over cookie layer and spread to cover completely.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>
            Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. 
            Cool completely before cutting into 20 bars.
